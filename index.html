      <p>
        My name is Roshni Singh, and I'm a self-taught artist and drummer, and I've been learning Japanese in my spare time. I am an incoming freshman at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Computing and Information. Girls Who Code (GWC) sparked my interest in coding during its Summer Immersion Program through HSBC Bank in 2022. I later went on to do the JP Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience, take AP Computer Science A at my high school, enroll in the GWC Fall Self-Paced Program '22, and now pursue the 2023 GWC Summer Self-Paced Program. My proudest accomplishment is the Gender Pay Gap project I did through the Data Science for Good course at GWC because it was the first project where I let my creativity break through by combining my interests in statistics and coding shine to address an issue that people widely discuss but do not fully grasp. I hope to major in computer science with a minor in statistics, pursue research, and work towards getting a master's degree before I begin to work in the STEM workforce.
